# RESTaurant

In order to run this app, you will need to have installed Docker CLI

Navigate into this folder with a terminal and type
```
docker-compose up
```
It is recommended to use two different browsers (not just two   windows on the same browser) to feel the true RESTaurant experience: this way you can simulate different interactions between the workers.

By default, a list of users will be loaded in the database; at any time you can change it through the admin profile. 
For the login email and password are needed; while the password is the same for everybody and it is ```123456```, the emails change and are listed below:
1. admin@admin.RESTaurant.it
2. alfredo@waiter.RESTaurant.it
3. rita@waiter.RESTaurant.it
4. vincenzo@cook.RESTaurant.it
5. anna@cook.RESTaurant.it
6. federico@bar.RESTaurant.it
7. susanna@bar.RESTaurant.it
8. laura@cash.RESTaurant.it
9. cosimo@cash.RESTaurant.it
    
They are divided by roles and there are two worker for each of them: their role is directly written in the email.
